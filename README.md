# Music Releases
This project was about building a music release app with React, using collected data from Spotify.
This project was done pair programming by Linn√©a Wilhelmsson and Emelie Cruz.

## The problem
We had most issues with the building of the site, like collecting the right data from the Spotify API. 
We used React, Javascript and CSS mostly for this site. It was a great exercise to start exploring JS components.

If we had more time we would focus more on improving the accessibility of the code. It would also be fun to play with icons more and eg. make the heart filled in when clicking on it.
